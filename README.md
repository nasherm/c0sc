My work done as I  read [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

This consists of two parts

## Plox (status: complete)
This is an interpreter for Lox written in Python.

### Usage
    ./plox.py <lox-script>

or use the REPL

    ./plox.py

## Golox (status: building)
This is a interpreter/bytecode VM for Lox written in Go
